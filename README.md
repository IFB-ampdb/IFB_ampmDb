# IFB's Antimicrobial Peptide Multidimensional Database

###Objective:
#### This project aims to decrease the costs of *in-silico* antibiotic research. How ? Read the scientific text below.


Recently there has been a dangerous increase of drug-resistant pathogenous micro organisms. The antimicrobial peptides are part of the first layer of the immunologic system, and create a natural passive defense agains infections.
They could be a solution to the rising problem of antibiotic-resistant microbes [1].

This project is the creation of a web system that contains multidimensional information about antimicrobial peptides, and make them available to the scientific community. This system will contain in its database multidimensional information about the known peptides, cutting the research costs by making information easier to obtain, with non trivial information made available in a simple web search.
